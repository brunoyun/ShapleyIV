This tool is inspired from previous works in the literature:

    * On the Measure of Conflicts: Shapley Inconsistency Values. Hunter and Konieczny (2010).
    * Inconsistency Measures for Repair Semantics in OBDA. Yun et al (2018).

Description
==================

* This tool is designed for decision-making using three types of inconsistency measures (and values) from an inconsistent knowledge base.

* The framework is composed of the following items:
    * A set of options in debate
    * A set of users
    * A context that describe the characteristics of the options
    * A knowledge base for each user composed of preference statements and rules.
